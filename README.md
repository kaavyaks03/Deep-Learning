# Dimensionality Reduction - Auto Encoders


### *Image Dimensionality Reduction!*

## Objective
This project aims at reducing the Dimensions of Images using the Encoder part of Auto Encoder Function. This is a part of Deep Learning project that aims at the domain of Image Processing. This project focus on implementing the Encoder function for a sample dimensional data set. it also shows the results of reduced dimensional features from high to low.
